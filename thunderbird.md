## Sending UTF-8 message by AOL mail

When I wanted send a message in my native language, my whole message would replace by question mark (?) and it was pain in ass. I should login in aol mail site and send that mail. so after digging around and searching for 1 hour, finally I found the solution.

Solution: Edit -> Preferences -> Advanced -> Config Editor -> mail.strictly_mime -> change it to true
